# Core SPA ðŸš€

More info can be found on Notion/FE documentation but this repo will mainly help designing the render functions that will generate all the components from our REST API.

## How to run

For this:
- `npm install -g pnpm` (if PNPM is not available yet)
- `pnpm i`
- `pnpm dev` (or `nr` for a more friendly experience)
